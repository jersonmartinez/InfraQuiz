🔄 `variable.variable_name`
📦 `var[variable_name]`
🎯 `variable[variable_name]`

**Correct Answer:**
📝 `var.variable_name`

**Explanation:**
⚡ Use `var.variable_name` to reference variables in your Terraform configuration. The `var` prefix tells Terraform you're referencing a variable, not a resource or data source! 🎯

---

### 🤔 What is a Terraform data source? 🟡

📝 A way to fetch information about resources that exist outside of Terraform
🔄 A source code repository for Terraform
