# Python Quiz 3 - Advanced

❓ What is the purpose of Python decorators? 🔴

📝 Modify or enhance functions without changing their code
⚙️ Improve performance
🧱 Reduce memory usage
📦 Simplify syntax

💡 Decorators allow you to modify or enhance functions by wrapping them with additional functionality without changing their original code.

---

❓ Which Python feature allows for lazy evaluation? 🟡

📝 Generators
⚙️ Lists
🧱 Tuples
📦 Dictionaries

💡 Generators provide lazy evaluation by yielding values one at a time, conserving memory for large datasets.

---

❓ What does the `__init__` method do in Python classes? 🟢

📝 Initialize object attributes when creating instances
⚙️ Define class methods
🧱 Create class variables
📦 Handle class inheritance

💡 The `__init__` method is a constructor that initializes object attributes when creating new instances of a class.

---

❓ Which Python concept allows functions to remember their state? 🟡

📝 Closures
⚙️ Recursion
🧱 Iterators
📦 Decorators

💡 Closures allow inner functions to remember and access variables from their enclosing scope even after the outer function has finished executing.

---

❓ What is the purpose of Python's `with` statement? 🟢

📝 Automatically manage resource cleanup
⚙️ Improve performance
🧱 Reduce memory usage
📦 Simplify syntax

💡 The `with` statement automatically handles resource cleanup, such as closing files, even if exceptions occur.

---

❓ Which Python feature allows for multiple inheritance? 🟢

📝 Multiple base classes in class definition
⚙️ Function overloading
🧱 Method chaining
📦 Operator overloading

💡 Python supports multiple inheritance by allowing a class to inherit from multiple base classes simultaneously.

---

❓ What does the `@property` decorator do? 🟡

📝 Convert methods to read-only attributes
⚙️ Improve performance
🧱 Reduce memory usage
📦 Simplify syntax

💡 The `@property` decorator allows you to access a method like an attribute, providing getter functionality.

---

❓ Which Python concept allows for dynamic attribute access? 🟡

📝 `__getattr__` and `__setattr__` methods
⚙️ Regular attributes
🧱 Static methods
📦 Class methods

💡 These special methods allow classes to dynamically handle attribute access and modification.

---

❓ What is the purpose of Python's `super()` function? 🟢

📝 Call methods from parent classes
⚙️ Create new objects
🧱 Delete objects
📦 Modify objects

💡 The `super()` function allows you to call methods from parent classes, useful in inheritance scenarios.

---

❓ Which Python feature allows for context management? 🟡

📝 Context managers with `__enter__` and `__exit__`
⚙️ Exception handling
🧱 Resource management
📦 Memory management

💡 Context managers implement `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods to handle setup and cleanup operations.

---

❓ What does the `@staticmethod` decorator do? 🟡

📝 Define methods that don't require instance or class
⚙️ Improve performance
🧱 Reduce memory usage
📦 Simplify syntax

💡 Static methods don't receive the instance or class as the first argument and can be called on the class directly.

---

❓ Which Python concept allows for operator overloading? 🟡

📝 Special methods like `__add__`, `__sub__`
⚙️ Regular methods
🧱 Static methods
📦 Class methods

💡 Special methods allow you to define how operators work with custom objects.

---

❓ What is the purpose of Python's `__slots__` attribute? 🟡

📝 Optimize memory usage by restricting attributes
⚙️ Improve performance
🧱 Simplify syntax
📦 Reduce code complexity

💡 `__slots__` restricts the attributes that can be assigned to instances, reducing memory usage.

---

❓ Which Python feature allows for metaprogramming? 🟡

📝 Metaclasses
⚙️ Regular classes
🧱 Functions
📦 Modules

💡 Metaclasses allow you to create and modify classes programmatically, enabling advanced metaprogramming techniques.

---

❓ What does the `@classmethod` decorator do? 🟡

📝 Define methods that receive the class as first argument
⚙️ Improve performance
🧱 Reduce memory usage
📦 Simplify syntax

💡 Class methods receive the class as the first argument and can be called on the class or instances.

---

❓ Which Python concept allows for descriptor protocol? 🟡

📝 `__get__`, `__set__`, `__delete__` methods
⚙️ Regular attributes
🧱 Static methods
📦 Class methods

💡 The descriptor protocol allows objects to customize attribute access, assignment, and deletion.

---

❓ What is the purpose of Python's `__call__` method? 🟡

📝 Make objects callable like functions
⚙️ Improve performance
🧱 Reduce memory usage
📦 Simplify syntax

💡 The `__call__` method allows instances to be called like functions.

---

❓ Which Python feature allows for abstract base classes? 🟡

📝 `abc` module with abstract methods
⚙️ Regular classes
🧱 Interfaces
📦 Protocols

💡 The `abc` module allows you to define abstract base classes with abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.

---

❓ What does the `@functools.lru_cache` decorator do? 🟡

📝 Cache function results to avoid recomputation
⚙️ Improve performance
🧱 Reduce memory usage
📦 Simplify syntax

💡 This decorator caches function results using an LRU (Least Recently Used) strategy to avoid recomputing expensive operations.

---

❓ Which Python concept allows for coroutines? 🟡

📝 `async` and `await` keywords
⚙️ Regular functions
🧱 Generators
📦 Threads

💡 Coroutines use `async` and `await` keywords to enable asynchronous programming and cooperative multitasking.

---

❓ What is the purpose of Python's `__new__` method? 🔴

📝 Control object creation process
⚙️ Initialize object attributes
🧱 Handle object destruction
📦 Manage object lifecycle

💡 The `__new__` method controls the object creation process and is called before `__init__`.
