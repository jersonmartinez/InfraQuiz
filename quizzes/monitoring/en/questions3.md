📦 Monitor databases

💡 Service mesh observability provides insights into service-to-service communication, traffic patterns, and dependencies.

---

❓ Which monitoring metric is most important for user experience? 🟢

📝 Response time
⚙️ CPU usage
🧱 Memory usage
📦 Disk I/O

💡 Response time directly impacts user experience and is a key indicator of application performance.

---

❓ What does the whitebox monitoring approach provide? 🟡

📝 Internal application and system metrics
⚙️ External user experience metrics
🧱 Network performance metrics
📦 Infrastructure metrics

💡 Whitebox monitoring provides detailed internal metrics about application performance and system resources.

---

❓ Which tool is used for visualizing monitoring data? 🟢

📝 Grafana
⚙️ Prometheus
🧱 Elasticsearch
📦 Logstash

💡 Grafana is a popular visualization tool that can connect to various data sources to create dashboards and charts.

---

❓ What is the purpose of synthetic monitoring? 🟡

📝 Simulate user interactions and transactions
⚙️ Monitor real user behavior
🧱 Monitor system resources
📦 Monitor network performance

💡 Synthetic monitoring uses automated scripts to simulate user interactions and verify application functionality.

---

❓ Which monitoring pattern helps with capacity planning? 🟡

📝 Trend analysis and forecasting
⚙️ Real-time monitoring
🧱 Alerting
📦 Log analysis

💡 Trend analysis helps predict future resource needs and plan capacity accordingly.

---

❓ What does the golden signals monitoring approach focus on? 🟢

📝 Latency, traffic, errors, and saturation
⚙️ CPU, memory, disk, and network
🧱 Response time, throughput, and availability
📦 User experience and business metrics

💡 The golden signals (latency, traffic, errors, saturation) provide a comprehensive view of service health.

---

❓ Which tool is used for distributed tracing? 🟡

📝 Jaeger
⚙️ Prometheus
🧱 Grafana
📦 ELK Stack

💡 Jaeger is a distributed tracing system that helps monitor and troubleshoot transactions in microservices architectures.

---

❓ What is the purpose of correlation IDs in monitoring? 🟡

📝 Track requests across multiple services
⚙️ Identify individual users
🧱 Monitor performance
📦 Track errors

💡 Correlation IDs help trace requests as they flow through multiple services in distributed systems.

---

❓ Which monitoring approach is best for detecting anomalies? 🟡

📝 Machine learning-based anomaly detection
⚙️ Threshold-based alerting
🧱 Manual monitoring
📦 Scheduled checks

💡 Machine learning can identify patterns and detect anomalies that might be missed by simple threshold-based monitoring.

---

❓ What does the RED method in monitoring stand for? 🟢

📝 Rate, Errors, Duration
⚙️ Response, Errors, Data
🧱 Request, Errors, Delay
📦 Reliability, Efficiency, Data

💡 The RED method focuses on Rate (requests per second), Errors (error rate), and Duration (response time).

---

❓ Which monitoring tool is used for infrastructure as code? 🟡

📝 Terraform with monitoring providers
⚙️ Ansible
🧱 Chef
📦 Puppet

💡 Terraform can provision monitoring infrastructure alongside application infrastructure for consistent deployment.
