---

❓ Which monitoring tool is open-source and commonly used with Kubernetes? 🟢

📝 Prometheus
⚙️ Nagios
🧱 Zabbix
📦 Datadog

💡 Prometheus is a popular open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for cloud-native environments.

---

❓ What is the purpose of blue-green deployment? 🟢

📝 Zero-downtime application updates
⚙️ Database migrations
🧱 Security updates
📦 Performance optimization

💡 Blue-green deployment allows you to switch traffic between two identical production environments for zero-downtime updates.

---

❓ Which protocol is commonly used for service discovery in microservices? 🟡

📝 HTTP/REST
⚙️ TCP
🧱 UDP
📦 FTP

💡 HTTP/REST is the most common protocol for service-to-service communication and discovery in microservices architectures.

---

❓ What does a circuit breaker pattern prevent? 🟡

📝 Cascading failures in distributed systems
⚙️ Database connection issues
🧱 Network latency
📦 Memory leaks

💡 Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures by temporarily stopping requests to failing services.

---

❓ Which tool is used for container orchestration? 🟢

📝 Kubernetes
⚙️ Docker Compose
🧱 Docker Swarm
📦 Mesos

💡 Kubernetes is the most popular container orchestration platform for managing containerized applications.

---

❓ What is the purpose of health checks in microservices? 🟢

📝 Monitor service availability and status
⚙️ Track user authentication
🧱 Monitor database performance
📦 Track API usage

💡 Health checks verify that services are running correctly and can respond to requests.

---

❓ Which pattern is used for handling distributed transactions? 🟡

📝 Saga pattern
⚙️ Observer pattern
🧱 Factory pattern
📦 Singleton pattern

💡 The Saga pattern manages distributed transactions by breaking them into local transactions with compensating actions.

---

❓ What does API Gateway provide in microservices? 🟢

📝 Single entry point for client requests
⚙️ Database connection management
🧱 Service discovery
📦 Load balancing only

💡 API Gateway acts as a single entry point, handling routing, authentication, and other cross-cutting concerns.

---

❓ Which tool is commonly used for log aggregation? 🟢

📝 ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
⚙️ Prometheus
🧱 Grafana
📦 Jaeger

💡 The ELK Stack is a popular solution for collecting, processing, and visualizing logs from multiple sources.

---

❓ What is the purpose of rate limiting in APIs? 🟢

📝 Prevent API abuse and ensure fair usage
⚙️ Improve performance
🧱 Reduce costs
📦 Enhance security

💡 Rate limiting prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests a client can make in a given time period.

---

❓ Which pattern is used for handling eventual consistency? 🟡

📝 Event sourcing
⚙️ CQRS
🧱 Saga pattern
📦 Circuit breaker

💡 Event sourcing stores all changes as a sequence of events, enabling eventual consistency and audit trails.

---

❓ What does a load balancer do? 🟢

📝 Distribute traffic across multiple servers
⚙️ Store session data
🧱 Authenticate users
📦 Cache responses

💡 Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and availability.

---

❓ Which tool is used for continuous integration? 🟢

📝 Jenkins
⚙️ GitLab CI
🧱 GitHub Actions
📦 All of the above

💡 All of these tools are commonly used for continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

---

❓ What is the purpose of secrets management? 🟡

📝 Securely store and manage sensitive data
⚙️ Improve application performance
🧱 Reduce costs
📦 Enhance monitoring

💡 Secrets management ensures sensitive information like passwords and API keys are stored and accessed securely.

---

❓ Which pattern is used for handling service failures gracefully? 🟡

📝 Retry pattern
⚙️ Circuit breaker
🧱 Bulkhead pattern
📦 All of the above

💡 These patterns work together to handle service failures gracefully and improve system resilience.

---

❓ What does a reverse proxy do? 🟢

📝 Forward client requests to backend services
⚙️ Cache static content
🧱 Load balance requests
📦 All of the above

💡 Reverse proxies can perform multiple functions including forwarding requests, caching, and load balancing.

---

❓ Which tool is used for infrastructure monitoring? 🟢

📝 Prometheus
⚙️ Grafana
🧱 Jaeger
📦 All of the above

💡 These tools work together for comprehensive infrastructure monitoring and observability.

---

❓ What is the purpose of service discovery? 🟢

📝 Locate and communicate with services dynamically
⚙️ Monitor service health
🧱 Manage service configuration
📦 Track service metrics

💡 Service discovery allows services to find and communicate with each other without hardcoded endpoints.
