💡 Defense in depth implements multiple layers of security controls to protect against various attack vectors.

---

❓ What does the principle of least privilege mean? 🟢

📝 Grant minimum access necessary for tasks
⚙️ Grant maximum access for efficiency
🧱 Grant equal access to all users
📦 Grant no access by default

💡 The principle of least privilege ensures users and systems have only the minimum access necessary to perform their required functions.

---

❓ Which security protocol provides secure communication? 🟢

📝 TLS/SSL
⚙️ HTTP

---

❓ Which security concept refers to zero trust? 🟡

📝 Never trust, always verify
⚙️ Trust but verify
🧱 Trust internal networks
📦 Trust authenticated users

💡 Zero trust assumes that threats exist both inside and outside the network and requires verification for every access attempt.

---

❓ What does penetration testing accomplish? 🟡

📝 Identify security vulnerabilities through authorized testing

📝 Issue and manage digital certificates
⚙️ Manage user accounts
🧱 Monitor network traffic
📦 Control access permissions

💡 Certificate authorities issue and manage digital certificates that verify the identity of entities and enable secure communication.

---

❓ Which security concept refers to data classification? 🟡

📝 Categorizing data by sensitivity and value
⚙️ Organizing data by size
🧱 Sorting data by date
📦 Grouping data by type

💡 Data classification helps determine appropriate security controls based on data sensitivity and business value.

---

❓ What does a security audit accomplish? 🟢

📝 Evaluate security controls and compliance
⚙️ Fix security vulnerabilities
🧱 Monitor network traffic
📦 Manage user access

💡 Security audits evaluate the effectiveness of security controls and ensure compliance with security policies and regulations.

---

❓ Which security protocol provides secure file transfer? 🟢

📝 SFTP
⚙️ FTP
🧱 HTTP
📦 SMTP

💡 SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) provides secure file transfer over encrypted SSH connections.

---

❓ What is the purpose of a security policy? 🟢

📝 Define security requirements and procedures
⚙️ Monitor security events
🧱 Fix security vulnerabilities
📦 Manage user access

💡 Security policies define organizational requirements, procedures, and responsibilities for maintaining security.

---

❓ Which security concept refers to threat modeling? 🟡

📝 Systematic approach to identifying security threats
⚙️ Random security testing
🧱 Basic vulnerability scanning
📦 Simple risk assessment

💡 Threat modeling systematically identifies potential security threats and vulnerabilities to design appropriate countermeasures.

---

❓ What does a security incident response plan provide? 🟢

📝 Structured approach to handling security incidents
⚙️ List of security tools
🧱 Security policy template
📦 Risk assessment framework

💡 Incident response plans provide structured procedures for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents.

---

❓ Which security measure protects against cross-site scripting? 🟢

📝 Input validation and output encoding
⚙️ Network segmentation only
🧱 Access control only
📦 Encryption only

💡 Protection against XSS requires both input validation and proper output encoding to prevent malicious scripts from executing.

---

❓ What is the purpose of a security awareness program? 🟢

📝 Educate users about security threats and best practices
⚙️ Monitor user behavior
🧱 Control user access
📦 Manage security tools

💡 Security awareness programs educate users about security threats, risks, and best practices to reduce human error.

---

❓ Which security concept refers to risk assessment? 🟡

📝 Systematic evaluation of security risks
⚙️ Basic security check

---

❓ What does a security baseline provide? 🟡

📝 Minimum security configuration standards
⚙️ Maximum security settings
🧱 Optional security features
📦 Advanced security tools

💡 Security baselines define minimum security configuration standards that systems must meet.

---

❓ Which security measure protects against privilege escalation? 🟡

📝 Access control and monitoring
⚙️ Encryption only
🧱 Network segmentation only
📦 Input validation only

💡 Protection against privilege escalation requires proper access controls and monitoring of user activities.

---
