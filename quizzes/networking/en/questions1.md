# 🌐 Networking - Questions 1

## Questions

### 1. 🌐 What is an IP address? 🟢

A) 📝 Unique identifier for devices on a network

B) 🔄 Internet protocol

C) 📦 Type of network cable

D) 🎯 Connectivity software

**Correct Answer**: A) 📝 Unique identifier for devices on a network

> 💡 An IP address is like your house's postal address, but for devices on the internet. Each device needs one to communicate!

### 2. 🔢 What's the difference between IPv4 and IPv6? 🟢

A) 📝 IPv4 uses 32 bits, IPv6 uses 128 bits

B) 🔄 IPv4 is newer than IPv6

C) 📦 IPv6 is slower than IPv4

D) 🎯 There's no practical difference

**Correct Answer**: A) 📝 IPv4 uses 32 bits, IPv6 uses 128 bits

> ⚡ IPv4 is running out (like phone numbers), IPv6 has vastly more addresses available. Like going from a village to a megacity!

### 3. 🚪 What is a port in networking? 🟢

A) 📝 Specific communication endpoint on a device

B) 🔄 Physical router entry

C) 📦 Connection cable

D) 🎯 Type of protocol

**Correct Answer**: A) 📝 Specific communication endpoint on a device

> 🏠 If IP is your house address, the port is the apartment number. Port 80 = web, port 22 = SSH, port 443 = HTTPS.

### 4. 📚 What is the OSI model? 🟡

A) 📝 7-layer model for network communication

B) 🔄 Operating system interface

C) 📦 Network security protocol

D) 🎯 Router configuration standard

**Correct Answer**: A) 📝 7-layer model for network communication

> 📖 OSI: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application. Like layers of an onion for networking!

### 5. 🔧 What is DNS? 🟢

A) 📝 Domain Name System - translates domain names to IP addresses

B) 🔄 Dynamic Network Service

C) 📦 Data Network Standard

D) 🎯 Device Name System

**Correct Answer**: A) 📝 Domain Name System - translates domain names to IP addresses

> 🌍 DNS is like a phone book for the internet. You type google.com, DNS finds the IP address for you!

### 6. 🌉 What is a subnet? 🟡

A) 📝 Network subdivision using subnet masks

B) 🔄 Underwater network cable

C) 📦 Security network protocol

D) 🎯 Network speed measurement

**Correct Answer**: A) 📝 Network subdivision using subnet masks

> 🏘️ Subnets divide large networks into smaller, manageable pieces. Like dividing a neighborhood into blocks!

### 7. 🔄 What is DHCP? 🟡

A) 📝 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol - automatically assigns IP addresses

B) 🔄 Direct Host Connection Protocol

C) 📦 Device Hardware Control Protocol

D) 🎯 Data Host Communication Protocol

**Correct Answer**: A) 📝 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol - automatically assigns IP addresses

> 🏠 DHCP is like an automatic postal service that assigns house numbers to new residents. No manual configuration needed!

### 8. 🔥 What is a firewall? 🟢

A) 📝 Network security system that monitors and controls traffic

B) 🔄 Fire protection system

C) 📦 Network speed controller

D) 🎯 Data encryption tool

**Correct Answer**: A) 📝 Network security system that monitors and controls traffic

> 🛡️ Firewalls are like security guards at the entrance of a building, checking who can enter and leave!

### 9. 🌐 What is NAT? 🟡

A) 📝 Network Address Translation - maps private IPs to public IPs

B) 🔄 Network Access Tool

C) 📦 Network Administration Technology

D) 🎯 Network Automation Technology

**Correct Answer**: A) 📝 Network Address Translation - maps private IPs to public IPs

> 🏢 NAT allows multiple devices to share one public IP address. Like an apartment building with one street address but many units!

### 10. 🔍 What is the ping command used for? 🟢

A) 📝 Test network connectivity to a host

B) 🔄 Measure network speed

C) 📦 Configure network settings

D) 🎯 Monitor network traffic

**Correct Answer**: A) 📝 Test network connectivity to a host

> 🏓 `ping` sends packets to check if a host is reachable and measures response time. Your first tool for network troubleshooting!
