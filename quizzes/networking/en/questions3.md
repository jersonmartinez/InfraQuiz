# Networking Quiz 3 - Advanced

❓ What is the purpose of BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)? 🔴

📝 Exchange routing information between autonomous systems
⚙️ Route traffic within a local network
🧱 Manage internal routing tables
📦 Handle local DNS resolution

💡 BGP is an exterior gateway protocol used to exchange routing information between different autonomous systems on the internet.

❓ Which protocol is used for dynamic host configuration? 🟢

📝 DHCP
⚙️ DNS
🧱 HTTP
📦 FTP

💡 DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) automatically assigns IP addresses and network configuration to devices.

---

❓ What does a subnet mask determine? 🟢

📝 Network portion of an IP address
⚙️ Host portion of an IP address
🧱 Gateway address
📦 DNS server address

💡 A subnet mask determines which portion of an IP address belongs to the network and which belongs to the host.

---

❓ Which networking device operates at Layer 2 of the OSI model? 🟢

📝 Switch
⚙️ Router
🧱 Firewall
📦 Load balancer

💡 Switches operate at Layer 2 (Data Link layer) and use MAC addresses to forward frames between devices.

---

❓ What is the purpose of VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)? 🟡

📝 Segment networks logically without physical separation
⚙️ Increase network bandwidth
🧱 Improve security
📦 Reduce network latency

💡 VLANs allow you to logically segment a single physical network into multiple virtual networks for better organization and security.

---

❓ Which protocol is used for secure remote access? 🟢

📝 SSH
⚙️ Telnet
🧱 FTP
📦 HTTP

💡 SSH (Secure Shell) provides encrypted remote access to network devices and servers.

---

❓ What does NAT (Network Address Translation) accomplish? 🟡

📝 Translate private IP addresses to public IP addresses
⚙️ Route traffic between networks
🧱 Filter network traffic
📦 Assign IP addresses

💡 NAT allows private IP addresses to be translated to public IP addresses for internet connectivity.

---

❓ Which networking concept refers to the maximum data transfer rate? 🟢

📝 Bandwidth
⚙️ Latency
🧱 Jitter
📦 Packet loss

💡 Bandwidth refers to the maximum data transfer rate that a network connection can support.

---

❓ What is the purpose of QoS (Quality of Service)? 🟡

📝 Prioritize network traffic based on requirements
⚙️ Increase network speed
🧱 Reduce network costs
📦 Improve security

💡 QoS allows you to prioritize network traffic based on application requirements and business needs.

---

❓ Which protocol is used for network time synchronization? 🟢

📝 NTP
⚙️ SNMP
🧱 SMTP
📦 POP3

💡 NTP (Network Time Protocol) synchronizes the time across network devices and systems.

---

❓ What does a default gateway do? 🟢

📝 Route traffic to other networks
⚙️ Assign IP addresses
🧱 Resolve domain names
📦 Filter network traffic

💡 A default gateway routes traffic from the local network to other networks, typically the internet.

---

❓ Which networking device operates at Layer 3 of the OSI model? 🟡

📝 Router
⚙️ Switch
🧱 Hub
📦 Bridge

💡 Routers operate at Layer 3 (Network layer) and use IP addresses to route packets between networks.

---

❓ What is the purpose of port forwarding? 🟡

📝 Redirect traffic from one port to another
⚙️ Block specific network ports
🧱 Increase network bandwidth
📦 Improve network security

💡 Port forwarding redirects traffic from one port to another, commonly used for hosting services behind NAT.

---

❓ Which protocol is used for network management and monitoring? 🟡

📝 SNMP
⚙️ SMTP
🧱 HTTP
📦 FTP

💡 SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is used for network management, monitoring, and device configuration.

---

❓ What does a DNS server resolve? 🟢

📝 Domain names to IP addresses
⚙️ IP addresses to domain names
🧱 MAC addresses to IP addresses
📦 Port numbers to services

💡 DNS servers resolve human-readable domain names to IP addresses that computers can understand.

---

❓ Which networking concept refers to network delay? 🟢

📝 Latency
⚙️ Bandwidth
🧱 Throughput
📦 Jitter

💡 Latency refers to the time it takes for data to travel from source to destination across the network.

---

❓ What is the purpose of network segmentation? 🟡

📝 Improve security and performance
⚙️ Increase network speed
🧱 Reduce network costs
📦 Simplify network management

💡 Network segmentation improves security by isolating network traffic and can improve performance by reducing broadcast domains.

---

❓ Which protocol is used for secure web browsing? 🟢

📝 HTTPS
⚙️ HTTP
🧱 FTP
📦 SMTP

💡 HTTPS (HTTP Secure) provides encrypted communication for secure web browsing and data transfer.

---

❓ What does a load balancer do? 🟢

📝 Distribute traffic across multiple servers
⚙️ Route traffic between networks
🧱 Filter network traffic
📦 Assign IP addresses

💡 Load balancers distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and availability.

---

❓ Which networking device operates at Layer 1 of the OSI model? 🟢

📝 Hub
⚙️ Switch
🧱 Router
📦 Firewall

💡 Hubs operate at Layer 1 (Physical layer) and simply repeat electrical signals to all connected devices.

---

❓ What is the purpose of network redundancy? 🟡

📝 Ensure network availability and reliability
⚙️ Increase network speed
🧱 Reduce network costs
📦 Improve network security

💡 Network redundancy provides backup paths and components to ensure network availability when primary components fail.
